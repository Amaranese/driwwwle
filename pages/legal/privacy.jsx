          Information we collect & how we use it

        <p className="mb-4">
          All the information which you choose to add to your profile (example:
          your name, photo, bio, and any other information) can be viewed by the
          users and the visitors of the Driwwwle. Once you create a profile,
          other users and visitors will be able to see in your profile certain
          information about your activity on the Driwwwle, such as your posts,
          who follows you, whom you follow, and how you interact with the other
          posts, for example, comments.

        <p className="mb-4">
          To give you the best possible experience while using Driwwwle, we
          collect information from your interactions with our network. Some of
          this information is explicitly provided by you, for example- your
          email address. Other information is collected by us based on actions
          you take while using Driwwwle, such as the pages you choose to view
          (including how much of a given page and for how long) and your use of
          product features (including the topics you follow and the posts you
          engage with). This information includes the records of all
          interactions a user has on the Driwwwle platform, a user’s IP
          (internet protocol) address, information about the user's device
          (which device you use or the type of browser), and referral
          information (how a user reached a particular page).

          We also receive information when you view content on or otherwise

          and time stamp, user agent, Driwwwle cookie ID (if applicable), URL,
          unique advertising or content identifiers (if applicable) and time
          zone, and other information about user activities on Driwwwle, as well

          Driwwwle might choose to transfer your account information with third
          parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2)
          to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection
          standards; (3) with researchers who are doing it for academic or
          non-profit purposes, through aggregation, anonymization, or
          pseudonymization; (4) when we believe it’s required and necessary for
          legal process; (5) when we believe that doing it might save someone
          from being harmed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If we are going to share your information in response to legal
          process, we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by
          seeking court intervention), unless the law prohibits us from doing so
          or we believe that giving you a prior notice might endanger someone
          else or would cause illegal conduct. We will ensure and object to
          legal requests for information that the Driwwwle Team believes are
          improper.

          Your Driwwwle’s user profile page, post pages, and interactions might
          be indexed by search engines such that they might appear against your

          Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you have a Driwwwle account, you can access, modify or export your
          personal information, or delete your account. To delete your account,

          We might choose to maintain residual copies (at our discretion) for a
          brief time period (maximum 6 months) in order to protect information
          from accidental or malicious destruction. However, if you choose to
          delete your account, your information and content can’t be recovered
          after that time. Driwwwle may preserve and maintain copies of your
          information beyond this time period when required to do so by law.

        <p className="mb-4">
          To protect data transmitted to and from our website/services, we use
          encryption (HTTPS/TLS). However, the Driwwwle team believes that our
          users understand that no data transmission is 100% secure over the
          Internet and a user is using Driwwwle’s website/services solely at
          his/her own risk/discretion. We recommend all the users on Driwwwle to
          take reasonable measures to secure their account.

          If Driwwwle is going to be involved in a merger, bankruptcy,
          acquisition,, reorganization or sale of assets and in doing us,
          Driwwwle is required to transfer its user information or it becomes
          subject to a different privacy policy, Driwwwle would notify all its
          users well in advance. This would give our users ample time to opt-out
          of any such new policy if they don’t agree with it and the users can
          choose to delete their account before transfer.

          Potential Consequences of Processing
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By creating and using an account on Driwwwle, users may make certain
          personal data about themselves public and accessible to others on
          their profile and through network interactions. Since all the users
          can have access to the profiles & the content posted by all other
          users, it may be possible for individuals/third parties to derive
          identifying personal data from posts, whether by reading, inference,
          research, and analysis
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If any user does not agree with and accept the risks that arise from
          the usage of Driwwwle’s platform/services, the user should choose to
          not use the Services.

          Driwwwle, you authorize Driwwwle to transfer, store, and use your
          information in India and any other country where we operate. If any of
          our processors are getting access to these data, they would be having
          at least the same level of data protection as that set out in this

          Driwwwle retains personal data associated with your account as long as
          your account exists on our platform. If a user wants to, he/she can
          delete all the personal information by deleting his/her account at any
          time. To delete your account, mail us at contact@driwwwle.com from
          your registered email address.

        <p className="mb-4">
          As soon as the deletion process is initiated, the profile page of that
